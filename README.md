# Sugar Consumption & Diabetes Prediction

My previous machine learning project, which predicts the **diabetes prevalence (%) from sugar consumption data.**

#Files in the Repository
- finalMLpro.ipynb` — Final Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, training, and plots.
- diabetes_model.pkl` — Trained RandomForestRegressor model.
- app.py` — Flask web app to make predictions.
- index.html` — The form UI for user input.
- sugar_consumption_dataset.csv` — The training dataset.
- `requirements.txt` — Packages that are required to run the app.

# Project Objective
Utilizing sugar consumption data to predict how common diabetes is among a given population.

# How to Run the App
```bash
cd Final_Predictor_Ready
python app.py
